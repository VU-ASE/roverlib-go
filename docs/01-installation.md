# Installation

:::info[Recommended approach]

It is not recommended to install this library manually. Instead, you can initialize a Go service using `roverctl` using [this command](https://ase.vu.nl/docs/framework/Software/rover/roverctl/usage/#initialize-a-service).

:::

The `roverlib-go` library can be installed using `go get` in any Go module as follows:

```bash
# Install the latest version
go get github.com/VU-ASE/roverlib-go
# Install a specific version
go get github.com/VU-ASE/roverlib-go@v1.2.6
```

Using the same commands, you can update or downgrade `roverlib-go` in-place in your Go module. All available versions that can be installed can be found [here](https://github.com/VU-ASE/roverlib-go/releases).

# Installation

The `roverlib-go` library can be installed using `go get` in any Go module as follows:

```bash
# Install the latest version
go get github.com/VU-ASE/roverlib-go
# Install a specific version
go get github.com/VU-ASE/roverlib-go@v1.2.6
```

Using the same commands, you can update or downgrade `roverlib-go` in-place in your Go module.
